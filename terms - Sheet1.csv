"Mendelian Inheritance,""Definition: The set of principles related to the transmission of hereditary characteristics from parent organisms to their offspring, formulated by Gregor Mendel based on his work with pea plants.; Characteristics: Involves discrete units of inheritance (genes) that come in pairs (alleles). Each individual inherits one allele from each parent. Traits can be dominant or recessive. Follows specific patterns such as the Law of Segregation and the Law of Independent Assortment.; Examples: Pea plant experiments showing traits like flower color and seed shape following predictable ratios in offspring. Human blood type inheritance where ABO blood types follow Mendelian principles.; Related Terms: Allele, Gene, Genotype, Phenotype, Homozygous, Heterozygous, Punnett Square; Important Scientists: Gregor Mendel"""
"Dominance,""Definition: A relationship between alleles of a gene in which one allele masks the expression of another allele at the same locus.; Characteristics: Dominant alleles express their trait even if only one copy is present (heterozygous condition). Recessive alleles require two copies (homozygous condition) to express their trait. Can be complete dominance where the dominant allele completely masks the recessive one or incomplete dominance where neither allele is completely dominant.; Examples: Flower color in pea plants where purple (P) is dominant over white (p). Huntington's disease in humans where having one copy of the mutated gene leads to disease manifestation.; Related Terms: Recessive Allele, Complete Dominance, Incomplete Dominance, Genotype, Phenotype; Important Scientists: Gregor Mendel"""
"Co-dominance,""Definition: A form of inheritance where both alleles at a locus contribute equally and visibly to the organism's phenotype; neither allele is recessive or masked by the other.; Characteristics: Both alleles are expressed simultaneously in heterozygotes without blending traits. Results in phenotypes that show both parental traits distinctly rather than an intermediate form.; Examples: ABO blood group system in humans where both A and B alleles are co-dominant. Individuals with genotype AB express both A and B antigens on red blood cells. Roan coat color in cattle where individuals have both red and white hairs intermixed due to co-dominant red and white coat color genes.; Related Terms: Allele, Genotype, Phenotype, Multiple Alleles; Important Scientists: Karl Landsteiner"""
