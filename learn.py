st.write("There are a few common scenarios where Session State is helpful. As demonstrated above, Session State is used when you have a progressive process that you want to build upon from one rerun to the next. Session State can also be used to prevent recalculation, similar to caching. For example, if you have a long-running computation that you want to run only once, you can use Session State to keep track of whether the computation has already been run. Finally, Session State can be used to keep track of widget state. For example, if you have a widget that you want to update based on another widget, you can use Session State to keep track of the state of the first widget.")
